// Project Description: a messaging platform that allows clients to connect and interact through messages.

// The Idea: create a platform that would allow several clients to connect and to send messages between themselves.

// Development: first the server was developed, allowing several clients to connect at the same time. The server is actively waiting for new messages and contains some business logic, allowing to exit the chat, change username or send message to other users. On the client side, the code captures messages sent by them and send it to the server.

// Tech && Methodologies: Java, Git
